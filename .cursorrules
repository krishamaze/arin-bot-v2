# Deployment
- Use `.env` file with `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (no browser login needed)
- Deploy: `npm run deploy` or `powershell -File scripts/deploy-to-cloud.ps1`
- CLI auto-uses `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var when set
- Load token: `$env:SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN = (Get-Content .env | Where-Object { $_ -match 'SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN\s*=' } | ForEach-Object { if ($_ -match '=\s*(.+)') { $matches[1].Trim() } })`

# Reference Implementation
- `_reference-implementation/` folder is READ-ONLY reference code for learning patterns
- DO NOT modify files in `_reference-implementation/` - it's for reference only
- When implementing similar features, refer to `_reference-implementation/` to understand patterns, then implement in the actual codebase
- This folder is gitignored and excluded from builds

# Code Style
- Keep repo clean. Remove temporary or unused files.
- Document only what's necessary for future development.
- Avoid unnecessary notes or clutter.
- Be direct, clear, and concise. No sugarcoating, no assumptions.
- Don't generate unwanted .md docs — use chat instead.
- Optimize for cognitive clarity, not cleverness.
- Prefer local context (cognitive locality). Avoid deep abstractions.
- Repeat code when it reduces cognitive load (PRY over DRY).
- Abstract only when enforcing consistent global behavior.
- Keep feedback kind and constructive.
- Review the codebase before building. Reuse existing components, functions, and RPCs whenever possible. Keep the system tight and consistent with minimal bloat — no redundant layers, no parallel logic. Extend, don't duplicate.
